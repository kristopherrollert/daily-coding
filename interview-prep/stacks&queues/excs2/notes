Stack Min: How would you design a stack in which, in addition to push and pop
has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop, and min
should all operate in O(1) time.

The difficulty comes with finding a way

We could keep track of min element, when new one comes we


ITS A STACK
keep a linked list of nodes representing mins?
when you pushed, if you are bigger than the node idgaf about you
if smaller, put ahead of me in linked list

when popping, check if top on min, if top, then remove it from there too

min just grabs the top element
