go through the array, matching characters. Once you get to one that isn't
matching, then you got your problem.

have different indexs for each one? that way we can offset?
break up into different functions for readability

removeable cases:
if string is more than 1 size larger => NO
if string is 1 size larger: must, remove
if string is 1 size smaller: must add
if string is the same size: must swtich (or do nothing)

switch:
loop through, if a charcter is different, that's fine. Set didEdit = True
if you get to another incorrect character, return false. Otherwise return tru

add:
loop through, until characters are different, then skip this letter and set didEdit = false
if you get to another incorrect character, return false. Otherwise return tru

remove and add are the same, depending on which string is first
