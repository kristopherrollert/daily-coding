# set up linked lists from root to node1 and node2
# then you can traverse the linked lists and compare elements till they match
# don't match, then the previous was the most in common.

# how do you make these linked lists.
# traversal. left then right. If none pop off of linked list.
# how about binary instead? left is 0 right is 1?
